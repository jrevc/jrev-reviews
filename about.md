### What is this?
This site holds a collection of book reviews that I have been writing since 2017. I started this project as an exercise in learning 11ty, Nunjucks, and to test new CSS techniques.

### Who am I?
My name is Jed R. Cruz, and reading is my hobby. I teach graphic design and web design, and I used to work on games for mobile devices.

I write book reviews as part of Fully Booked's First Look Club. The reviews on this site were originally published on the [Fully Booked blog](https://www.fullybookedonline.com/blog).

Get in touch with me at **jrevita@gmail.com**. I'm also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jrevita) and [Twitter](https://x.com/jrevita), but I don't post much.
